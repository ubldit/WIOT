For Arduino 1.6.2

Unzip "Arduino 1.6.2 Addon for WIOT.zip" into the arduino directory (i.e. C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Arduino15)
Note: This will overwrite the existing boards.txt   You may need to manually add the WIOT section if you have already installed other hardware Addons

Although the new 1.6.2 has a new board manager, it is unclear how to use this in this version.
There are forum posts talking about this feature being broken in 1.6.2.
We plan to integrate into this feature as soon as it is working.
